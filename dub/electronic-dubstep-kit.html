"mainEntity": [{
"@type": "Question","name": "Who makes best sample packs?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Determining who makes the best sample packs is subjective and depends on the specific needs and preferences of the user, including the genre of music they are producing. However, companies like Loopmasters, Splice, and Native Instruments are highly regarded in the industry for their wide range of high-quality sample packs across various genres. Independent creators on platforms like Splice can also offer unique and high-quality samples. Ultimately, the best sample pack is one that inspires creativity and fits seamlessly into a producer&#39;s workflow and musical style."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What did Skrillex invent?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Skrillex, born Sonny John Moore, is widely credited with popularizing the electronic dance music (EDM) genre known as dubstep in the United States and beyond. While he did not invent dubstep itself�a genre that originated in South London in the late 1990s�his unique approach and production style significantly influenced its evolution and brought it into the mainstream. Skrillex&#39;s aggressive and distinct blend of electronic music, characterized by its heavy use of bass and intricate, chopped-up samples, has had a lasting impact on the EDM scene and has inspired countless artists across various music genres."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What is the hardest drum beat?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The concept of the &quot;hardest drum beat&quot; is subjective and varies among drummers, depending on their skill level, experience, and style of music. However, some complex rhythms are widely recognized for their difficulty. For example, the &quot;Blast Beat,&quot; commonly used in extreme metal genres, requires rapid, synchronized hits on the snare and bass drum, challenging even seasoned drummers. Another example is the &quot;Purdie Shuffle,&quot; a groove that involves a nuanced, intricate pattern, demanding a high level of coordination and touch. These beats, among others, are often cited as challenging due to their speed, complexity, and the endurance they require."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why is dubstep called 140?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Dubstep is often referred to as &quot;140&quot; because of its characteristic tempo, which typically hovers around 140 beats per minute (BPM). This genre of electronic dance music emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s in South London, evolving from the roots of UK garage, drum and bass, and reggae. The tempo of 140 BPM is a defining feature that helps distinguish dubstep from other genres, providing a rhythmic framework for its deep basslines, reverberant drum patterns, and occasional vocals. This specific tempo contributes to the unique feel and energy of dubstep tracks, making &quot;140&quot; a shorthand reference to the genre itself among fans and producers."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is it illegal to sample drum breaks?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The legality of sampling drum breaks depends on how the sample is used and whether permission has been obtained from the original copyright holder. If a drum break from a copyrighted work is sampled without authorization, it could be considered copyright infringement, which is illegal. However, if the sample is cleared with the copyright owner through licensing or falls under fair use (which is determined on a case-by-case basis and might be difficult to prove), then it would not be illegal. It&#39;s important for creators to understand copyright laws and seek proper clearance when sampling copyrighted material to avoid legal issues."

"about":
[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Dubstep","description":"genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20474","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dubstep&kgmid=/m/07s72n"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Sampling (music)","description":"Sampling in music involves reusing portions of sound recordings to create new compositions, a technique that can include manipulation of rhythm, melody, and other elements through electronic instruments or software. Originating in the 1940s with musique concrète and evolving with the introduction of instruments like the Mellotron, sampling became foundational to hip hop and has significantly influenced electronic and pop music. The practice of sampling, while a contentious issue in copyright law, is defended by many as a creative act, despite the legal complexities and varying court rulings on unlicensed sampling.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q596446","https://www.google.com/search?=sampling%28music%29&kgmid=/m/0155s6"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Loop (music)","description":"A section of sound material that is repeated to form patterns or to accompany oneself, created using various music technologies like turntables, samplers, or software, and available in formats like MIDI or audio files. Loops, which can be short for creating ostinato patterns or longer for repeating entire song verses, have become integral to modern music production and can be royalty-free purchased from companies for creative use.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1758908"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"WAV","description":"A standard audio file format developed by IBM and Microsoft for storing an uncompressed audio bitstream on personal computers, predominantly used on Microsoft Windows systems. It leverages the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) for bitstream encoding and is an application of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), storing data in chunks similar to formats used on Amiga and Macintosh computers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217570","https://www.google.com/search?=wav&kgmid=/m/086m_"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Audio","description":"An audio file format encompasses the structure for storing digital audio data on a computer system, specifying how audio information is organized within the file. These formats can be categorized into uncompressed formats like WAV and AIFF, which retain sound data in its original form; lossless compressed formats like FLAC and ALAC, which reduce file size without sacrificing any audio data; and lossy compressed formats like MP3 and AAC, which significantly decrease file size by eliminating parts of the audio deemed less crucial for perceived quality. The distinction between the audio coding format (the bit layout of the audio data) and the container format (which stores the encoded data) is crucial, alongside understanding the role of codecs in encoding and decoding audio data.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P51"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Record Producer","description":"Oversees the creative and technical aspects of a music recording project, akin to the role of a film director, involving tasks from hands-on oversight of recording sessions to coordinating the production team and process. Their role can span creating the recording's sound and structure in popular music to acting as a liaison in classical recordings, with the role evolving significantly due to advances in recording technology and the advent of digital audio workstations. This evolution has expanded the possibilities for record production, allowing even novices in home studios to engage in skilled production work.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183945"]},

<div class="card-body"><p>Determining who makes the best sample packs is subjective and depends on the specific needs and preferences of the user, including the genre of music they are producing. However, companies like Loopmasters, Splice, and Native Instruments are highly regarded in the industry for their wide range of high-quality sample packs across various genres. Independent creators on platforms like Splice can also offer unique and high-quality samples.

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Skrillex, born Sonny John Moore, is widely credited with popularizing the electronic dance music (EDM) genre known as dubstep in the United States and beyond. While he did not invent dubstep itself�a genre that originated in South London in the late 1990s�his unique approach and production style significantly influenced its evolution and brought it into the mainstream. Skrillex&#39;s aggressive and distinct blend of electronic music, characterized by its heavy use of bass and intricate, chopped-up samples, has had a lasting impact on the EDM scene and has inspired countless artists across various music genres.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>The concept of the &quot;hardest drum beat&quot; is subjective and varies among drummers, depending on their skill level, experience, and style of music. However, some complex rhythms are widely recognized for their difficulty. For example, the &quot;Blast Beat,&quot; commonly used in extreme metal genres, requires rapid, synchronized hits on the snare and bass drum, challenging even seasoned drummers. Another example is the &quot;Purdie Shuffle,&quot; a groove that involves a nuanced, intricate pattern, demanding a high level of coordination and touch. These beats, among others, are often cited as challenging due to their speed, complexity, and the endurance they require.</p>

<h6 class="collapsed mb-0" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapse3" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapse3"> Why is dubstep called 140?<span class="lni-chevron-up"></span></h6>
</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Dubstep is often referred to as &quot;140&quot; because of its characteristic tempo, which typically hovers around 140 beats per minute (BPM). This genre of electronic dance music emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s in South London, evolving from the roots of UK garage, drum and bass, and reggae. The tempo of 140 BPM is a defining feature that helps distinguish dubstep from other genres, providing a rhythmic framework for its deep basslines, reverberant drum patterns, and occasional vocals. This specific tempo contributes to the unique feel and energy of dubstep tracks, making &quot;140&quot; a shorthand reference to the genre itself among fans and producers.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>The legality of sampling drum breaks depends on how the sample is used and whether permission has been obtained from the original copyright holder. If a drum break from a copyrighted work is sampled without authorization, it could be considered copyright infringement, which is illegal. However, if the sample is cleared with the copyright owner through licensing or falls under fair use (which is determined on a case-by-case basis and might be difficult to prove), then it would not be illegal. It&#39;s important for creators to understand copyright laws and seek proper clearance when sampling copyrighted material to avoid legal issues.</p>
