"mainEntity": [{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is it illegal to sample drum breaks?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The legality of sampling drum breaks depends on how the sample is used and whether permission has been obtained from the original copyright holder. If a drum break from a copyrighted work is sampled without authorization, it could be considered copyright infringement, which is illegal. However, if the sample is cleared with the copyright owner through licensing or falls under fair use (which is determined on a case-by-case basis and might be difficult to prove), then it would not be illegal. It&#39;s important for creators to understand copyright laws and seek proper clearance when sampling copyrighted material to avoid legal issues."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Who gets paid for a sample?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "When a sample of music, sound, or any other form of media is used in a new work, the original creator or copyright holder of the sampled material typically gets paid. This payment comes in the form of licensing fees or royalties, which are negotiated before the sample is used. The specifics of the payment can vary greatly depending on the popularity of the sample, the way it&#39;s being used, and the agreement between the parties involved. In some cases, the artist using the sample might also agree to give a percentage of their song&#39;s earnings to the original creator."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Can you sample dead artists?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, you can sample music from dead artists, but it&#39;s important to understand that the legality of doing so depends on copyright laws, which do not expire upon the artist&#39;s death. Copyrights in music are typically held for 70 years after the death of the last surviving author (in many jurisdictions). Therefore, to legally sample music from a deceased artist, you generally need to obtain permission from the copyright holder, which could be the artist&#39;s estate, a record label, or another entity that has acquired the rights. Failure to obtain the necessary permissions can result in legal action, including lawsuits for copyright infringement."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Do rappers get permission to sample?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Rappers, like other musicians, typically need to obtain permission to sample someone else&#39;s music in their tracks. This process involves clearing the sample, which means getting approval from the copyright holders of the original song, which could include the songwriter, performer, and record label. Failure to get proper clearance can lead to legal issues, including copyright infringement lawsuits. However, some artists choose to use samples without permission, either hoping not to be noticed or considering the potential legal battle worth the risk."

[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Dubstep","description":"genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20474","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dubstep&kgmid=/m/07s72n"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Sampling (music)","description":"Sampling in music involves reusing portions of sound recordings to create new compositions, a technique that can include manipulation of rhythm, melody, and other elements through electronic instruments or software. Originating in the 1940s with musique concrÃ¨te and evolving with the introduction of instruments like the Mellotron, sampling became foundational to hip hop and has significantly influenced electronic and pop music. The practice of sampling, while a contentious issue in copyright law, is defended by many as a creative act, despite the legal complexities and varying court rulings on unlicensed sampling.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q596446","https://www.google.com/search?=sampling%28music%29&kgmid=/m/0155s6"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Loop (music)","description":"A section of sound material that is repeated to form patterns or to accompany oneself, created using various music technologies like turntables, samplers, or software, and available in formats like MIDI or audio files. Loops, which can be short for creating ostinato patterns or longer for repeating entire song verses, have become integral to modern music production and can be royalty-free purchased from companies for creative use.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1758908"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"WAV","description":"A standard audio file format developed by IBM and Microsoft for storing an uncompressed audio bitstream on personal computers, predominantly used on Microsoft Windows systems. It leverages the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) for bitstream encoding and is an application of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), storing data in chunks similar to formats used on Amiga and Macintosh computers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217570","https://www.google.com/search?=wav&kgmid=/m/086m_"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Audio","description":"An audio file format encompasses the structure for storing digital audio data on a computer system, specifying how audio information is organized within the file. These formats can be categorized into uncompressed formats like WAV and AIFF, which retain sound data in its original form; lossless compressed formats like FLAC and ALAC, which reduce file size without sacrificing any audio data; and lossy compressed formats like MP3 and AAC, which significantly decrease file size by eliminating parts of the audio deemed less crucial for perceived quality. The distinction between the audio coding format (the bit layout of the audio data) and the container format (which stores the encoded data) is crucial, alongside understanding the role of codecs in encoding and decoding audio data.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P51"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Record Producer","description":"Oversees the creative and technical aspects of a music recording project, akin to the role of a film director, involving tasks from hands-on oversight of recording sessions to coordinating the production team and process. Their role can span creating the recording's sound and structure in popular music to acting as a liaison in classical recordings, with the role evolving significantly due to advances in recording technology and the advent of digital audio workstations. This evolution has expanded the possibilities for record production, allowing even novices in home studios to engage in skilled production work.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183945"]},

<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>The legality of sampling drum breaks depends on how the sample is used and whether permission has been obtained from the original copyright holder. If a drum break from a copyrighted work is sampled without authorization, it could be considered copyright infringement, which is illegal. However, if the sample is cleared with the copyright owner through licensing or falls under fair use (which is determined on a case-by-case basis and might be difficult to prove), then it would not be illegal. It&#39;s important for creators to understand copyright laws and seek proper clearance when sampling copyrighted material to avoid legal issues.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>When a sample of music, sound, or any other form of media is used in a new work, the original creator or copyright holder of the sampled material typically gets paid. This payment comes in the form of licensing fees or royalties, which are negotiated before the sample is used. The specifics of the payment can vary greatly depending on the popularity of the sample, the way it&#39;s being used, and the agreement between the parties involved. In some cases, the artist using the sample might also agree to give a percentage of their song&#39;s earnings to the original creator.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, you can sample music from dead artists, but it&#39;s important to understand that the legality of doing so depends on copyright laws, which do not expire upon the artist&#39;s death. Copyrights in music are typically held for 70 years after the death of the last surviving author (in many jurisdictions). Therefore, to legally sample music from a deceased artist, you generally need to obtain permission from the copyright holder, which could be the artist&#39;s estate, a record label, or another entity that has acquired the rights. Failure to obtain the necessary permissions can result in legal action, including lawsuits for copyright infringement.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Rappers, like other musicians, typically need to obtain permission to sample someone else&#39;s music in their tracks. This process involves clearing the sample, which means getting approval from the copyright holders of the original song, which could include the songwriter, performer, and record label. Failure to get proper clearance can lead to legal issues, including copyright infringement lawsuits. However, some artists choose to use samples without permission, either hoping not to be noticed or considering the potential legal battle worth the risk.</p>
