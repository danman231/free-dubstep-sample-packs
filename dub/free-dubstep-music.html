"mainEntity": [{
"@type": "Question","name": "What genre is Skrillex?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Skrillex is primarily known for his work in the electronic dance music (EDM) genre, specifically within the subgenres of dubstep, electro house, and brostep. His music is characterized by its aggressive sound, complex bass lines, and high energy beats. Skrillex, whose real name is Sonny John Moore, has been a pivotal figure in popularizing dubstep and has significantly influenced the EDM scene worldwide."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is Skrillex the creator of dubstep?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "No, Skrillex is not the creator of dubstep. Dubstep originated in the late 1990s in South London, emerging from the genres of UK garage, drum and bass, and reggae. While Skrillex, an American electronic music producer and DJ, has been one of the most prominent figures in popularizing dubstep globally in the early 2010s, the genre&#39;s creation predates his involvement. Skrillex is known for his influential role in bringing a more aggressive form of dubstep to a wider audience, but he is not the genre&#39;s originator."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Do artists pay for samples?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Artists often have to pay for the use of samples in their music, which involves clearing the sample with the original copyright holders. This process can include paying upfront fees and agreeing to give a percentage of the song&#39;s royalties to the owners of the sampled material. The cost and terms of using a sample can vary widely, depending on the popularity of the original song and how the sample is used. Failure to properly clear a sample can lead to legal issues and financial penalties for the artist."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How many samples should be in a sample pack?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The number of samples in a sample pack can vary widely depending on the purpose and context of the sample pack. For consumer products, a sample pack might contain anywhere from 3 to 10 samples, allowing customers to try a range of products before making a purchase decision. In research or scientific settings, the number of samples could be much higher, determined by statistical requirements for the study. Ultimately, the ideal number of samples in a pack is influenced by factors such as cost, intended use, and the need for variety or comprehensiveness."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Does dubstep fall under EDM?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, dubstep falls under the broad category of Electronic Dance Music (EDM). It is a genre of electronic music that originated in the late 1990s in South London. Dubstep is characterized by its sparse, syncopated rhythmic patterns with prominent sub-bass frequencies. As a subgenre of EDM, dubstep has gained significant popularity and has influenced many other genres within electronic music."

[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Dubstep","description":"genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20474","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dubstep&kgmid=/m/07s72n"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Sampling (music)","description":"Sampling in music involves reusing portions of sound recordings to create new compositions, a technique that can include manipulation of rhythm, melody, and other elements through electronic instruments or software. Originating in the 1940s with musique concrète and evolving with the introduction of instruments like the Mellotron, sampling became foundational to hip hop and has significantly influenced electronic and pop music. The practice of sampling, while a contentious issue in copyright law, is defended by many as a creative act, despite the legal complexities and varying court rulings on unlicensed sampling.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q596446","https://www.google.com/search?=sampling%28music%29&kgmid=/m/0155s6"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Loop (music)","description":"A section of sound material that is repeated to form patterns or to accompany oneself, created using various music technologies like turntables, samplers, or software, and available in formats like MIDI or audio files. Loops, which can be short for creating ostinato patterns or longer for repeating entire song verses, have become integral to modern music production and can be royalty-free purchased from companies for creative use.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1758908"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"WAV","description":"A standard audio file format developed by IBM and Microsoft for storing an uncompressed audio bitstream on personal computers, predominantly used on Microsoft Windows systems. It leverages the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) for bitstream encoding and is an application of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), storing data in chunks similar to formats used on Amiga and Macintosh computers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217570","https://www.google.com/search?=wav&kgmid=/m/086m_"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Audio","description":"An audio file format encompasses the structure for storing digital audio data on a computer system, specifying how audio information is organized within the file. These formats can be categorized into uncompressed formats like WAV and AIFF, which retain sound data in its original form; lossless compressed formats like FLAC and ALAC, which reduce file size without sacrificing any audio data; and lossy compressed formats like MP3 and AAC, which significantly decrease file size by eliminating parts of the audio deemed less crucial for perceived quality. The distinction between the audio coding format (the bit layout of the audio data) and the container format (which stores the encoded data) is crucial, alongside understanding the role of codecs in encoding and decoding audio data.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P51"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Record Producer","description":"Oversees the creative and technical aspects of a music recording project, akin to the role of a film director, involving tasks from hands-on oversight of recording sessions to coordinating the production team and process. Their role can span creating the recording's sound and structure in popular music to acting as a liaison in classical recordings, with the role evolving significantly due to advances in recording technology and the advent of digital audio workstations. This evolution has expanded the possibilities for record production, allowing even novices in home studios to engage in skilled production work.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183945"]},
