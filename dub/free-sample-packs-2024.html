"mainEntity": [{
"@type": "Question","name": "Can you sample dead artists?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, you can sample music from dead artists, but it&#39;s important to understand that the legality of doing so depends on copyright laws, which do not expire upon the artist&#39;s death. Copyrights in music are typically held for 70 years after the death of the last surviving author (in many jurisdictions). Therefore, to legally sample music from a deceased artist, you generally need to obtain permission from the copyright holder, which could be the artist&#39;s estate, a record label, or another entity that has acquired the rights. Failure to obtain the necessary permissions can result in legal action, including lawsuits for copyright infringement."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Do rappers get permission to sample?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Rappers, like other musicians, typically need to obtain permission to sample someone else&#39;s music in their tracks. This process involves clearing the sample, which means getting approval from the copyright holders of the original song, which could include the songwriter, performer, and record label. Failure to get proper clearance can lead to legal issues, including copyright infringement lawsuits. However, some artists choose to use samples without permission, either hoping not to be noticed or considering the potential legal battle worth the risk."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What song is baddest of them all sampling?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The song &quot;Baddest of Them All&quot; samples the track &quot;Flowers&quot; by Sweet Female Attitude, which is a UK garage song released in the year 2000. The sampled melody and elements from &quot;Flowers&quot; are integrated into &quot;Baddest of Them All,&quot; giving it a nostalgic yet fresh feel. This combination of old and new has contributed to the song&#39;s popularity on various social media platforms and music charts."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What the f is dubstep?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London in the late 1990s. It is characterized by its sparse, syncopated rhythmic patterns with prominent sub-bass frequencies, and the occasional use of reggae-like drum patterns. The genre gained significant popularity in the early to mid-2000s and has influenced many other genres of music. Dubstep is known for its heavy use of wobble bass, where an instrument&#39;s volume or pitch is manipulated, creating a distinctive sound."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why did Skrillex disappear?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Skrillex, the renowned electronic music producer and DJ, didn&#39;t exactly disappear but rather took a step back from the limelight to focus on various aspects of his career and personal growth. After achieving massive success and a hectic touring schedule, he decided to take some time off to work on new music, explore different creative projects, and collaborate with other artists in a more behind-the-scenes capacity. This period of relative quietude was also a time for him to recharge and seek inspiration for future works. Despite being less visible in the mainstream media, Skrillex continued to influence the music industry through his production work and occasional performances."

[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Dubstep","description":"genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20474","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dubstep&kgmid=/m/07s72n"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Sampling (music)","description":"Sampling in music involves reusing portions of sound recordings to create new compositions, a technique that can include manipulation of rhythm, melody, and other elements through electronic instruments or software. Originating in the 1940s with musique concrète and evolving with the introduction of instruments like the Mellotron, sampling became foundational to hip hop and has significantly influenced electronic and pop music. The practice of sampling, while a contentious issue in copyright law, is defended by many as a creative act, despite the legal complexities and varying court rulings on unlicensed sampling.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q596446","https://www.google.com/search?=sampling%28music%29&kgmid=/m/0155s6"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Loop (music)","description":"A section of sound material that is repeated to form patterns or to accompany oneself, created using various music technologies like turntables, samplers, or software, and available in formats like MIDI or audio files. Loops, which can be short for creating ostinato patterns or longer for repeating entire song verses, have become integral to modern music production and can be royalty-free purchased from companies for creative use.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1758908"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"WAV","description":"A standard audio file format developed by IBM and Microsoft for storing an uncompressed audio bitstream on personal computers, predominantly used on Microsoft Windows systems. It leverages the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) for bitstream encoding and is an application of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), storing data in chunks similar to formats used on Amiga and Macintosh computers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217570","https://www.google.com/search?=wav&kgmid=/m/086m_"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Audio","description":"An audio file format encompasses the structure for storing digital audio data on a computer system, specifying how audio information is organized within the file. These formats can be categorized into uncompressed formats like WAV and AIFF, which retain sound data in its original form; lossless compressed formats like FLAC and ALAC, which reduce file size without sacrificing any audio data; and lossy compressed formats like MP3 and AAC, which significantly decrease file size by eliminating parts of the audio deemed less crucial for perceived quality. The distinction between the audio coding format (the bit layout of the audio data) and the container format (which stores the encoded data) is crucial, alongside understanding the role of codecs in encoding and decoding audio data.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P51"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Record Producer","description":"Oversees the creative and technical aspects of a music recording project, akin to the role of a film director, involving tasks from hands-on oversight of recording sessions to coordinating the production team and process. Their role can span creating the recording's sound and structure in popular music to acting as a liaison in classical recordings, with the role evolving significantly due to advances in recording technology and the advent of digital audio workstations. This evolution has expanded the possibilities for record production, allowing even novices in home studios to engage in skilled production work.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183945"]},

<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, you can sample music from dead artists, but it&#39;s important to understand that the legality of doing so depends on copyright laws, which do not expire upon the artist&#39;s death. Copyrights in music are typically held for 70 years after the death of the last surviving author (in many jurisdictions). Therefore, to legally sample music from a deceased artist, you generally need to obtain permission from the copyright holder, which could be the artist&#39;s estate, a record label, or another entity that has acquired the rights. Failure to obtain the necessary permissions can result in legal action, including lawsuits for copyright infringement.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Rappers, like other musicians, typically need to obtain permission to sample someone else&#39;s music in their tracks. This process involves clearing the sample, which means getting approval from the copyright holders of the original song, which could include the songwriter, performer, and record label. Failure to get proper clearance can lead to legal issues, including copyright infringement lawsuits. However, some artists choose to use samples without permission, either hoping not to be noticed or considering the potential legal battle worth the risk.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London in the late 1990s. It is characterized by its sparse, syncopated rhythmic patterns with prominent sub-bass frequencies, and the occasional use of reggae-like drum patterns. The genre gained significant popularity in the early to mid-2000s and has influenced many other genres of music. Dubstep is known for its heavy use of wobble bass, where an instrument&#39;s volume or pitch is manipulated, creating a distinctive sound.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Skrillex, the renowned electronic music producer and DJ, didn&#39;t exactly disappear but rather took a step back from the limelight to focus on various aspects of his career and personal growth. After achieving massive success and a hectic touring schedule, he decided to take some time off to work on new music, explore different creative projects, and collaborate with other artists in a more behind-the-scenes capacity. This period of relative quietude was also a time for him to recharge and seek inspiration for future works. Despite being less visible in the mainstream media, Skrillex continued to influence the music industry through his production work and occasional performances.</p>
