"mainEntity": [{
"@type": "Question","name": "What are you legally allowed to sample?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Legally, you are allowed to sample copyrighted material under certain conditions that fall under the doctrine of fair use. This includes using small portions of a work for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, the legality of sampling also depends on factors like the amount of the work used, the nature of the copyrighted work, the effect on the market value of the original work, and the purpose of the use. It&#39;s important to note that these rules can vary by country, and in some cases, explicit permission from the copyright holder may be required to avoid legal issues."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What is the most sampled song in history?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The most sampled song in history is &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; by The Winstons, a B-side of the 1969 single &quot;Color Him Father.&quot; The six-second drum break in the middle of the song, known as the &quot;Amen Break,&quot; has been extensively sampled and reused in various genres, especially in hip hop, drum and bass, and jungle music. Its widespread use has made it a foundational element in the development of these genres, although for many years, the original artists did not receive royalties or recognition for its ubiquitous use. The &quot;Amen Break&quot; is not just a piece of music history but a cornerstone in the evolution of electronic and sampled music."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Do sampled artists get royalties?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, sampled artists typically receive royalties for the use of their work. When a piece of music is sampled and used in a new song, the original artist or copyright holder must be credited and compensated, which is often done through a licensing agreement. This agreement outlines the terms for how the sample can be used and what royalties will be paid. The specifics of the royalty payments, such as the amount and how they are calculated, can vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why do people buy sample packs?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "People buy sample packs primarily to try out a variety of products before committing to purchasing full-sized versions. Sample packs allow consumers to experiment with different flavors, scents, or product formulations to determine what best suits their preferences and needs without the financial commitment of a larger purchase. Additionally, sample packs are convenient for travel and offer a way to explore new products or brands that one might not have considered otherwise. This approach helps in making more informed purchasing decisions and reduces the risk of dissatisfaction with a product."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What kind of techno is Skrillex?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Skrillex is primarily known for his work in the dubstep genre, which is a subgenre of electronic dance music (EDM). His music incorporates elements of various other genres including electro house, post-dubstep, and brostep, a subgenre of dubstep. Skrillex&#39;s style is characterized by complex drum patterns, aggressive basslines, and the use of samples and synthesizers to create high-energy tracks. While not purely techno, his innovative approach has influenced a wide range of electronic music styles."

"about":
[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Dubstep","description":"genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20474","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dubstep&kgmid=/m/07s72n"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Sampling (music)","description":"Sampling in music involves reusing portions of sound recordings to create new compositions, a technique that can include manipulation of rhythm, melody, and other elements through electronic instruments or software. Originating in the 1940s with musique concrète and evolving with the introduction of instruments like the Mellotron, sampling became foundational to hip hop and has significantly influenced electronic and pop music. The practice of sampling, while a contentious issue in copyright law, is defended by many as a creative act, despite the legal complexities and varying court rulings on unlicensed sampling.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q596446","https://www.google.com/search?=sampling%28music%29&kgmid=/m/0155s6"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Loop (music)","description":"A section of sound material that is repeated to form patterns or to accompany oneself, created using various music technologies like turntables, samplers, or software, and available in formats like MIDI or audio files. Loops, which can be short for creating ostinato patterns or longer for repeating entire song verses, have become integral to modern music production and can be royalty-free purchased from companies for creative use.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1758908"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"WAV","description":"A standard audio file format developed by IBM and Microsoft for storing an uncompressed audio bitstream on personal computers, predominantly used on Microsoft Windows systems. It leverages the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) for bitstream encoding and is an application of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), storing data in chunks similar to formats used on Amiga and Macintosh computers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217570","https://www.google.com/search?=wav&kgmid=/m/086m_"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Audio","description":"An audio file format encompasses the structure for storing digital audio data on a computer system, specifying how audio information is organized within the file. These formats can be categorized into uncompressed formats like WAV and AIFF, which retain sound data in its original form; lossless compressed formats like FLAC and ALAC, which reduce file size without sacrificing any audio data; and lossy compressed formats like MP3 and AAC, which significantly decrease file size by eliminating parts of the audio deemed less crucial for perceived quality. The distinction between the audio coding format (the bit layout of the audio data) and the container format (which stores the encoded data) is crucial, alongside understanding the role of codecs in encoding and decoding audio data.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P51"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Record Producer","description":"Oversees the creative and technical aspects of a music recording project, akin to the role of a film director, involving tasks from hands-on oversight of recording sessions to coordinating the production team and process. Their role can span creating the recording's sound and structure in popular music to acting as a liaison in classical recordings, with the role evolving significantly due to advances in recording technology and the advent of digital audio workstations. This evolution has expanded the possibilities for record production, allowing even novices in home studios to engage in skilled production work.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183945"]},

<div class="card-body"><p>Legally, you are allowed to sample copyrighted material under certain conditions that fall under the doctrine of fair use. This includes using small portions of a work for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, the legality of sampling also depends on factors like the amount of the work used, the nature of the copyrighted work, the effect on the market value of the original work, and the purpose of the use. It&#39;s important to note that these rules can vary by country, and in some cases, explicit permission from the copyright holder may be required to avoid legal issues.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>The most sampled song in history is &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; by The Winstons, a B-side of the 1969 single &quot;Color Him Father.&quot; The six-second drum break in the middle of the song, known as the &quot;Amen Break,&quot; has been extensively sampled and reused in various genres, especially in hip hop, drum and bass, and jungle music. Its widespread use has made it a foundational element in the development of these genres, although for many years, the original artists did not receive royalties or recognition for its ubiquitous use.

<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, sampled artists typically receive royalties for the use of their work. When a piece of music is sampled and used in a new song, the original artist or copyright holder must be credited and compensated, which is often done through a licensing agreement. This agreement outlines the terms for how the sample can be used and what royalties will be paid. The specifics of the royalty payments, such as the amount and how they are calculated, can vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved.</p>

Additionally, sample packs are convenient for travel and offer a way to explore new products or brands that one might not have considered otherwise. This approach helps in making more informed purchasing decisions and reduces the risk of dissatisfaction with a product.</p>
