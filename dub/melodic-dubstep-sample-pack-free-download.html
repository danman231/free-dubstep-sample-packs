"@type": "Question","name": "What is modern dubstep called?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Modern dubstep, often referred to as &quot;brostep&quot; in the United States, is a subgenre of dubstep that emerged in the late 2000s and early 2010s. It is characterized by its aggressive style, featuring high energy levels, heavy use of wobble bass, and complex, syncopated rhythms. Artists like Skrillex, Excision, and Knife Party are among the most notable figures in this subgenre, having played a significant role in popularizing the sound and bringing it to a broader audience. Brostep has significantly influenced the direction of electronic music, blending elements of dubstep with other genres to create a distinct, energetic sound."

"about":
[{"@type":"Thing","name":"Dubstep","description":"genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20474","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dubstep&kgmid=/m/07s72n"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Sampling (music)","description":"Sampling in music involves reusing portions of sound recordings to create new compositions, a technique that can include manipulation of rhythm, melody, and other elements through electronic instruments or software. Originating in the 1940s with musique concrète and evolving with the introduction of instruments like the Mellotron, sampling became foundational to hip hop and has significantly influenced electronic and pop music. The practice of sampling, while a contentious issue in copyright law, is defended by many as a creative act, despite the legal complexities and varying court rulings on unlicensed sampling.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q596446","https://www.google.com/search?=sampling%28music%29&kgmid=/m/0155s6"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Loop (music)","description":"A section of sound material that is repeated to form patterns or to accompany oneself, created using various music technologies like turntables, samplers, or software, and available in formats like MIDI or audio files. Loops, which can be short for creating ostinato patterns or longer for repeating entire song verses, have become integral to modern music production and can be royalty-free purchased from companies for creative use.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1758908"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"WAV","description":"A standard audio file format developed by IBM and Microsoft for storing an uncompressed audio bitstream on personal computers, predominantly used on Microsoft Windows systems. It leverages the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) for bitstream encoding and is an application of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), storing data in chunks similar to formats used on Amiga and Macintosh computers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217570","https://www.google.com/search?=wav&kgmid=/m/086m_"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Audio","description":"An audio file format encompasses the structure for storing digital audio data on a computer system, specifying how audio information is organized within the file. These formats can be categorized into uncompressed formats like WAV and AIFF, which retain sound data in its original form; lossless compressed formats like FLAC and ALAC, which reduce file size without sacrificing any audio data; and lossy compressed formats like MP3 and AAC, which significantly decrease file size by eliminating parts of the audio deemed less crucial for perceived quality. The distinction between the audio coding format (the bit layout of the audio data) and the container format (which stores the encoded data) is crucial, alongside understanding the role of codecs in encoding and decoding audio data.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P51"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Record Producer","description":"Oversees the creative and technical aspects of a music recording project, akin to the role of a film director, involving tasks from hands-on oversight of recording sessions to coordinating the production team and process. Their role can span creating the recording's sound and structure in popular music to acting as a liaison in classical recordings, with the role evolving significantly due to advances in recording technology and the advent of digital audio workstations. This evolution has expanded the possibilities for record production, allowing even novices in home studios to engage in skilled production work.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183945"]},
