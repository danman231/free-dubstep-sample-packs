"mainEntity": [{
"@type": "Question","name": "What chords are banned by the church?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Historically, the tritone, also known as the &quot;diabolus in musica&quot; or the devil in music, was the interval that faced significant scrutiny and was often avoided in medieval church music. This interval, spanning three whole tones, was thought to evoke feelings of unrest and was considered dissonant and unsettling. As a result, it was largely avoided in compositions intended for religious settings. However, the idea of chords being &quot;banned&quot; by the church is more a reflection of the musical preferences and compositional practices of the time rather than an official prohibition."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What happens if you get caught sampling?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "If you get caught sampling without permission, the consequences can vary depending on the context and jurisdiction. In the music industry, for example, this could lead to legal action from the copyright holder, potentially resulting in hefty fines or a court order to cease distribution of the infringing work. Additionally, it could damage your reputation among peers and consumers, making future collaborations or licensing agreements more difficult to secure. In academic or research settings, unauthorized sampling could lead to disciplinary actions, including expulsion or termination, and harm your professional credibility."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What is the parent genre of dubstep?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The parent genre of dubstep is electronic dance music (EDM). It originated in the late 1990s in South London, evolving from genres like UK garage, drum and bass, and reggae. Dubstep is characterized by its sparse, syncopated rhythmic patterns with prominent sub-bass frequencies. Over time, it has grown into a significant and influential genre within the broader spectrum of electronic music."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Where do rappers get samples?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Rappers often get samples from a wide range of sources, including old records, CDs, digital music libraries, and online sample databases. They might sample parts of songs from various genres, including soul, funk, jazz, and even classical music, to create new beats or musical backgrounds for their tracks. Additionally, there are companies and websites dedicated to providing royalty-free samples and loops that can be legally used in music production. Producers and rappers may also work with musicians to create original samples specifically for their projects."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is sampling music lazy?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Sampling music is not inherently lazy; it is a creative process that involves selecting portions of pre-existing music to create something new and original. This technique requires a deep understanding of music, a keen ear for detail, and the ability to envision a new composition from existing pieces. Many respected artists across various genres have used sampling to produce groundbreaking and critically acclaimed works. Therefore, sampling is better viewed as a legitimate and innovative musical practice rather than a shortcut to creativity."

{"@type":"Thing","name":"Sampling (music)","description":"Sampling in music involves reusing portions of sound recordings to create new compositions, a technique that can include manipulation of rhythm, melody, and other elements through electronic instruments or software. Originating in the 1940s with musique concrète and evolving with the introduction of instruments like the Mellotron, sampling became foundational to hip hop and has significantly influenced electronic and pop music. The practice of sampling, while a contentious issue in copyright law, is defended by many as a creative act, despite the legal complexities and varying court rulings on unlicensed sampling.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q596446","https://www.google.com/search?=sampling%28music%29&kgmid=/m/0155s6"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Loop (music)","description":"A section of sound material that is repeated to form patterns or to accompany oneself, created using various music technologies like turntables, samplers, or software, and available in formats like MIDI or audio files. Loops, which can be short for creating ostinato patterns or longer for repeating entire song verses, have become integral to modern music production and can be royalty-free purchased from companies for creative use.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1758908"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"WAV","description":"A standard audio file format developed by IBM and Microsoft for storing an uncompressed audio bitstream on personal computers, predominantly used on Microsoft Windows systems. It leverages the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) for bitstream encoding and is an application of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), storing data in chunks similar to formats used on Amiga and Macintosh computers.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217570","https://www.google.com/search?=wav&kgmid=/m/086m_"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Audio","description":"An audio file format encompasses the structure for storing digital audio data on a computer system, specifying how audio information is organized within the file. These formats can be categorized into uncompressed formats like WAV and AIFF, which retain sound data in its original form; lossless compressed formats like FLAC and ALAC, which reduce file size without sacrificing any audio data; and lossy compressed formats like MP3 and AAC, which significantly decrease file size by eliminating parts of the audio deemed less crucial for perceived quality. The distinction between the audio coding format (the bit layout of the audio data) and the container format (which stores the encoded data) is crucial, alongside understanding the role of codecs in encoding and decoding audio data.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P51"]},
{"@type":"Thing","name":"Record Producer","description":"Oversees the creative and technical aspects of a music recording project, akin to the role of a film director, involving tasks from hands-on oversight of recording sessions to coordinating the production team and process. Their role can span creating the recording's sound and structure in popular music to acting as a liaison in classical recordings, with the role evolving significantly due to advances in recording technology and the advent of digital audio workstations. This evolution has expanded the possibilities for record production, allowing even novices in home studios to engage in skilled production work.","sameAs":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer","https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183945"]},

<div class="card-body"><p>Historically, the tritone, also known as the &quot;diabolus in musica&quot; or the devil in music, was the interval that faced significant scrutiny and was often avoided in medieval church music. This interval, spanning three whole tones, was thought to evoke feelings of unrest and was considered dissonant and unsettling. As a result, it was largely avoided in compositions intended for religious settings. However, the idea of chords being &quot;banned&quot; by the church is more a reflection of the musical preferences and compositional practices of the time rather than an official prohibition.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Sampling music is not inherently lazy; it is a creative process that involves selecting portions of pre-existing music to create something new and original. This technique requires a deep understanding of music, a keen ear for detail, and the ability to envision a new composition from existing pieces. Many respected artists across various genres have used sampling to produce groundbreaking and critically acclaimed works. Therefore, sampling is better viewed as a legitimate and innovative musical practice rather than a shortcut to creativity.</p>
